      <div id="content" style="font-family:junicode,Times New Roman,serif; font-size:14pt; line-height: 1.5;"><span class="teiLine ">At the beginning of the ninth century CE the Carolingian Empire encompassed large
            parts
            of what is now Western Europe. As early as the 830s, however, a process of political
            fragmentation began which led to the creation of the West, the Middle and the East
            Frankish Kingdom. These developed into independent units, despite formally remaining
            part of the Empire until 888.</span><span class="teiLine ">The project "<span style="">Margins at the Centre</span>" focuses on the East Frankish Kingdom and examines whether the process leading to
            political independence also entailed a new self-consciousness in the cultural sphere,
            i.e. whether East Frankish scholars developed their own approaches, especially with
            regard to the study of Latin and the Bible. These were the two disciplines which were
            most thoroughly addressed in the Middle Ages. The Bible, which circulated in Latin
            in Western Europe, was the point of reference for moral, social, political and spiritual
            life. Therefore, it formed the main subject of scholarly interest in this period.
            Command of Latin was essential to understand the Bible's text, its message, and the
            numerous explanations written by Christian exegetes over the centuries. While Latin
            in its medieval forms was still spoken in many regions of the Carolingian Empire,
            it was a foreign language in the East Frankish Kingdom. Here it had to be learnt from
            scratch by studying grammar.</span><span class="teiLine ">With all this being considered, <span style="">the main questions addressed </span>by the project are: Did East Frankish scholars teach Latin differently from their
            contemporary fellows because of the different linguistic setting of their audiences?
            Did they find a particular way to communicate the contents of the Bible to their students
            and to those members of the lay elite who could read and understand Latin? Did they
            take into account possible difficulties of their East Frankish public when writing
            down their explanations of Latin grammar and the Bible? The existence of a peculiar
            East Frankish approach to Latin and the Bible has so far been asserted by relying
            on the study of the contemporary glosses and literary output in Old High German. The
            far more numerous and extensive interpretations in Latin, however, have rarely been
            investigated in order to verify and substantiate such a statement.</span><span class="teiLine "></span><span class="teiLine ">...</span><span class="teiLine ">The investigation will begin in the monasteries of St. Gall and Wissembourg during
            the time of Grimald's abbacy (ca. 833-872). It will initially concentrate on annotated
            manuscripts of both the Bible and of Priscian's <span>Institutiones Grammaticae</span>, some of them in fragmentary form. In a further step, contemporary books of the same
            format, which were produced both within and outside the East Frankish Kingdom, will
            be compared.</span><span class="teiLine "><span style="">The provisional list of manuscripts which will be taken into account comprises:</span></span><ul>
